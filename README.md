# 1934. Confirmation Rate

- ### Intuition and Approach for Calculating Confirmation Rate
    The task is to calculate the **confirmation rate** for each user, which is defined as the ratio of the number of 'confirmed' actions to the total number of confirmation requests for each user. The approach is similar across SQL, PySpark, and Pandas, with only the syntax and specific functions differing. Here's the intuition behind the approach:

- ### Intuition
    1. **Confirmations and Requests**: 
        - We have two main tables: `Signups` (which records when users signed up) and `Confirmations` (which records when users requested a confirmation). Each request can either be 'confirmed' or 'timeout'.
        - For each user, we need to calculate the confirmation rate, which is the number of successful ('confirmed') confirmation requests divided by the total number of confirmation requests they made.
        - A user who did not request any confirmation messages will have a confirmation rate of `0`.

    2. **Handling Missing Data**:
        - If a user has no confirmation requests, they will not appear in the `Confirmations` table, but we still need to consider them in the `Signups` table with a confirmation rate of `0`.
        - We need to handle missing or `null` values properly, ensuring that users with no confirmations are accounted for with a rate of `0`.

    3. **Joins and Grouping**:
        - We need to join the `Signups` table with the `Confirmations` table to aggregate the required data (e.g., the number of confirmations and the total number of requests) for each user.
        - We perform grouping by `user_id` to aggregate the confirmation counts and total requests for each user.

    4. **Final Calculation**:
        - The final calculation is simply dividing the number of confirmed requests by the total requests for each user, ensuring that we handle the case where a user has no requests (to avoid division by zero).

- ### Approach (Common for PySpark, SQL, and Pandas)
    1. **Filter for Confirmed Actions**:
        - First, filter the `Confirmations` table to retain only the records where the action is 'confirmed'. This gives us the data on successful confirmation requests.
    
    2. **Join with Signups**:
        - Perform a left join between the `Signups` table and the filtered `Confirmations` table. This ensures that we can count the number of 'confirmed' actions for each user and also account for users with no confirmation requests.
    
    3. **Count Confirmation Requests**:
        - Count the number of confirmation actions per user (i.e., how many times each user has requested a confirmation). This count includes both 'confirmed' and 'timeout' actions.
        - Also count the number of 'confirmed' actions for each user (i.e., how many successful confirmation requests the user had).

    4. **Handle Missing Data**:
        - For users who did not request any confirmation (i.e., those that do not have matching rows in the `Confirmations` table), we need to set their confirmation count to `0` and handle their total count correctly.
    
    5. **Calculate the Confirmation Rate**:
        - For each user, calculate the confirmation rate by dividing the number of 'confirmed' actions by the total number of confirmation actions. If a user has no requests, their confirmation rate should be set to `0`.
    
    6. **Return the Results**:
        - The final result is a table (or DataFrame) containing the `user_id` and their corresponding confirmation rate, rounded to two decimal places.

- ### Key Considerations
    - **Edge Cases**:
        - Users with no confirmation requests at all should be included with a rate of `0`.
        - Users with only 'timeout' actions should have a rate of `0`.
        - Division by zero should be handled when calculating the confirmation rate.
        
    - **Efficiency**:
        - Depending on the size of the data, ensure efficient handling of joins and aggregations. In PySpark, this involves using `groupBy` and `agg` operations, whereas in SQL, this involves `GROUP BY` and `COUNT` functions. In Pandas, we use `groupby` and aggregation functions.

    - **Null Handling**:
        - Make sure to account for missing values (`None` or `NaN`) in the confirmation actions, and ensure they don't impact the count or calculations inappropriately.
